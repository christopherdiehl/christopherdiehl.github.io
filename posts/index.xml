      <description>Building a music suggesting webapp in barebones Go For some additional background, the team I work with has a weekly Talking Code where one member talks about something they&amp;rsquo;ve worked on and would like to share with the group. Given my interest in Golang outside of work, I decided to make a web application that would randomly suggest a song given a genre. I also wanted to use as few libraries as possible to hide any package magic.</description>

      <description>Background I&amp;rsquo;m going to assume you have experience with Lambda, AWS-SAM, and Cloudformation. To start with you should already have a template.yml for Cloudformation that looks alot like this:
--- AWSTemplateFormatVersion: &#39;2010-09-09&#39; Transform: AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31 Description: AWS template Resources: ApiGatewayApi: Type: AWS::Serverless::Api Properties: StageName: Prod # Allows www.example.com to call these APIs # SAM will automatically add AllowMethods with a list of methods for this API Cors: &amp;quot;&#39;www.example.com&#39;&amp;quot; DefinitionBody: &#39;Fn::Transform&#39;: Name: &#39;AWS::Include&#39; # Replace &amp;lt;bucket&amp;gt; with your bucket name Parameters: Location: s3://&amp;lt;bucket&amp;gt;/swagger.</description>

      <description>Golang Password Cracker Disclaimer All views and opinions expressed in this document are my own and not indicative of my employer&amp;rsquo;s viewpoints in any regard. Furthermore, this exercise is intended to demonstrate the need for more robust passwords. The created program should not be used for anything malicious.
Password Security &amp;amp; Best Practices Krebs Take
I&amp;rsquo;m sure we&amp;rsquo;ve all seen user accounts with shoddy passwords, to demonstrate how easy it is to gain access to these accounts let&amp;rsquo;s see if we can brute force their passwords.</description>

      <description>Intro I recently created a filter bar using the popular Reselect and Redux libraries in React. For this post, we&amp;rsquo;re going to create a filter bar in a standard contacts page, where the contacts will be filtered by individual&amp;rsquo;s name.
Here is an example of how the contacts page will look with the filter.
Reducer Setup First we need to create the reducer and the initial state of our application, let&amp;rsquo;s use Immutable.</description>

      <title>Golang Configure Cors REST API</title>

      <description>Intro I recently ran into some CORS issues while creating a REST API in Go. Because I spend the bulk of my time programming in JavaScript, I had at first assumed there would be an easy catch all CORS package that I could configure and never think about again. Then I remembered that part of Go&amp;rsquo;s beauty is it&amp;rsquo;s standard library, so I decided to solve the problem by myself, and while doing so learned a lot about HTTP and CORS.</description>
