      <description>Intro I recently ran into some CORS issues while creating a REST API in Go. Because I spend the bulk of my time programming in JavaScript, I had at first assumed there would be an easy catch all CORS package that I could configure and never think about again. Then I remembered that part of Go&amp;rsquo;s beauty is it&amp;rsquo;s standard library, so I decided to solve the problem by myself, and while doing so learned a lot about HTTP and CORS.</description>

      <description>One of my resolutions going into 2018 was to blog more about the technical problems I run into, in the hopes it helps someone else. Things have been incredibly busy this year, but I finally got around to migrating my blog to Hugo so expect to see more content focused on the Node, React, and Golang ecosystems!</description>
